## üìî Security Considerations
Official Security Considerations from the [Official MCP Specification Rev: 2025-03-26](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools)

- Servers **MUST**:
  - Validate all tool inputs
  - Implement proper access controls
  - Rate limit tool invocations
  - Sanitize tool outputs
    
- Clients **SHOULD**:
  - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations
  - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or accidental data exfiltration
  - Validate tool results before passing to LLM
  - Implement timeouts for tool calls
  - Log tool usage for audit purposes
    
> [!WARNING]  
> For trust & safety and security, clients **MUST** consider tool annotations to be untrusted unless they come from trusted servers.

> [!WARNING]  
> For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop* with the ability to deny tool invocations.
>
> Applications **SHOULD**:
>
> - Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model.
> - Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked.
> - Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the loop.

> [!NOTE]  
> *Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) means that user help monitor and guide automated tasks, like deciding whether to accept tool requests in Cursor.
